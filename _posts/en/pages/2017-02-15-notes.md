  * [Google Guice's Motivation wikipage](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation): Dependency Injection using concrete examples.
  * [Misko Hevery's guide to Writing Testable Code](http://misko.hevery.com/attachments/Guide-Writing%20Testable%20Code.pdf) ([alt.]({{ "/assets/docs/Guide-Writing Testable Code.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})): excellent set of best practices, recipes & examples (& counter-examples) to write well designed and well tested code.

* Levelling:
  Career levels can be thought of as rails going from point `A` to point `B`:
  `A --> B`

  - At L4 (Software Engineer level), you are given `A`, `-->`, and `B`, and need
    to drive successfully from `A` to `B`.
  - At L5 (Senior Software Engineer level), you are not given `-->`, and need to
    decide _how_ to get from `A` to `B` in the best possible way.
  - At L6 (Staff Software Engineer level), you are not given `-->` and `B`, and
    additionally need to define where we should be going.
  - At L7 you are given nothing, and you need to create structure for your
    world, from scratch.
