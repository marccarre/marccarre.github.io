Here is a selection of technical reads I have enjoyed:

* Test-Driven Development (TDD) & Dependency Injection (DI):

  * [Uncle Bob's Bowling Game Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata) ([PPT](http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt), [alt.]({{ "/assets/docs/Bowling Game Kata.ppt" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})): TDD by example, and in constrast with the "[Big Design Up Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Design_Up_Front)" approach.
  * [Google Guice's Motivation wikipage](https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation): Dependency Injection using concrete examples.
  * [Misko Hevery's guide to Writing Testable Code](http://misko.hevery.com/attachments/Guide-Writing%20Testable%20Code.pdf) ([alt.]({{ "/assets/docs/Guide-Writing Testable Code.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})): excellent set of best practices, recipes & examples (& counter-examples) to write well designed and well tested code.
