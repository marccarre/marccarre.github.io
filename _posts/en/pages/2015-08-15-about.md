I am a passionate software engineer who loves:

* solving complex problems
* learning new technologies
* finding ways to improve the way I and my team work
* building robust and modular software.

I am currently most interested in:

* high performance computing
* distributed systems
* machine learning (NLP, RL)

I currently develop mainly using:

* Go (which I ~~really hate~~ find OK-ish)
* Python
* Scala
* Java

and I enjoy playing with Rust (which I like very much).
