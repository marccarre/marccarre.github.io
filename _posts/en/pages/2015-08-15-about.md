Hi,

My name is Marc.
I am a software engineer with experience in ML, Data, Cloud infrastructure,
applied to Automotive, Market Finance and SaaS, who enjoys efficient, robust and
modular solutions to complex problems, and finding ways to improve the way I and
my team(s) work.

<br />

I am currently based in Tokyo where I lead the development of the ML Platform
enabling [AD/ADAS](https://woven.toyota/en/ad-adas-technology/) (Autonomous
Driving / Advanced Driver-Assistance System) development at Woven by Toyota,
with people like [Wadim Kehl](https://wadimkehl.github.io/).
Previously, I was engineer, team lead, platform lead, and then architect
on [Arene](https://woven.toyota/en/arene/)'s Data Platform, working on vehicle
data collection to support AD/ADAS' development and Arene's data-driven software
quality, with people like [JF Bastien](https://jfbastien.com/).

Before that, I was at [Weaveworks](https://github.com/weaveworks), the company
which coined "[GitOps](https://github.com/weaveworks/awesome-gitops)", where
I worked on container networking (when it was not trivial to wire two containers
together), observability, continuous delivery, and self-healing cloud
infrastructure (e.g. I wrote one of the first Kubernetes operators against its
nacent, so-called "Cluster API"). This included work on both Open Source
Software and a SaaS product (~120 microservices running on Kubernetes).

Before that, I was at J.P. Morgan, in London, where I worked on a pricer for
equity exotics and got exposure to financial engineering, and then a distributed
timeseries database (and an ecosystem of market data feeds, compute platform,
etc.) to enable real-time pricing and risk analysis.

In parallel of some of the above, I also co-founded, Sway, a company where we
analysed patterns in social networks, and helped our customers engaged with
the right people in their communities.

<br />

I currently mostly write Rust and Python.
Over the years, in addition to these two, I have writen C, C++, C#, Java, Scala,
Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, Ruby, and Go.
